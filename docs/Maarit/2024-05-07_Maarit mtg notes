------------------------

Year is a cross factor, include as a fixed effect
Block can be random

Count - plants per m2

Get GDDs to describe differences in planting dates

A question:
Are weed counts the following spring related to CC data from previous fall?
If not, that is an interesting result. 
Bo says early establishment prevents you from controlling thistles. 
The cover crop treatments are 'packages', I need to understand this better

Is % volunteer inversely related to % cc?

Glm w/proportions, the answers are in ratios

cbind(x, y, z, A) ~ Till + (1|straw) + (1|Straw:tillage) + etc...

+ till*straw*cc*yearF

soil/cc vs volunteers/cc

2018 - spring barley
2019 - oat
2020 - faba bean
